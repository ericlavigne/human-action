### To Do
About section will not embed a keynote, it will instead show the slides using
javascript to pull the different elements of the already designed keynote.
Chip and Eddie are going to work on resizing all elements. We will practice
with two elements to see how if we are on the right track as far as the
dimensions of the site go.

Liberation Sans font to be used on web page. We need to install it on our local
machines and we need to make sure it loads it on our users machine.
